These scripts and files will be thrown away after we use gtfs from transitland.

PG install:

These scripts import feeds from NYC via ./makeNYC_pg.sh.  Prerequisites for the
scripts are:  1.  Install postgresql and create a gtfs db.  2.  Spatial 
enable the db via: CREATE EXTENSION postgis;  3.  Update dbuser var in
import.sh to your db username.  4.  Install csvfilter via: sudo pip install csvfilter.

Run ./makeNYC_pg.sh

NOTE:  LIRR puts all of the calendar entries in the calendar_dates.txt
file.  Therefore, you will see an error for their feed:
ERROR:  could not open file "/data/valhalla/mjolnir/gtfs/schedule.txt" for reading: No such file or directory

Please disregard the above error.


sqlite install:

These scripts import feeds from NYC via ./makeNYC_sqlite.sh.  Prerequisites for the
scripts are:  1.  Install spatialite and sqlite.  2.  Install sqlparse which is used
by termsql.  3.  Install termsql via git clone https://github.com/tobimensch/termsql.git 
and run sudo python setup.py install

Run ./makeNYC_sqlite.sh

Again LIRR will produce errors that you should ignore.
